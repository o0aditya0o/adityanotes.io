                Not in a dramatic sense. More in a quiet, everyday way. We don’t like having too many open questions about our lives. We don’t like sitting with “I don’t know” for very long.
            </p>
            <p>
                So when a decision shows up, especially an important one, we start hunting for clarity as quickly as we can.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Should I stay or should I leave?</li>
                <li>Should I switch teams or not?</li>
                <li>Should I move or not?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Once we land on an answer, there’s a sense of relief. It feels like progress. It feels responsible.
            </p>
            <p>
                But I’ve slowly started to believe that this instinct is often backwards.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Clarity is useful. But only after you’ve explored.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                A common example I see, especially in careers, is around switching teams.
            </p>
            <p>
                People usually think about it like this: <br />
                “Let me first decide whether I want to leave my team. And if I decide yes, then I’ll start looking around.”
            </p>
            <p>
                On the surface, this sounds reasonable. In practice, it’s limiting.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because you’re trying to make a decision about unknown options.
            </p>
            <h3>A better approach, in my experience, is almost the opposite.</h3>
            <p>
                Don’t decide yet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Start talking to other teams. Have casual conversations. Ask what they’re working on. Sit in on a design review if you can.
            </p>
            <p>
                At first, this doesn’t give you clarity. It gives you more confusion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now you’re aware of three interesting teams. Two boring ones. One that sounded great until you learned more. Your simple binary choice just became a messy web of possibilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                That messiness is not failure. That messiness is information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Only after you’ve seen what’s out there does the original question start to make sense. Now you’re no longer choosing between “stay vs leave.” You’re choosing between specific realities.
            </p>
            <h3>The same pattern shows up outside work too.</h3>
            <p>
                Think about deciding where to live. Many people pick a city based on a vague idea, a short visit, or someone else’s opinion. But when you actually visit multiple places, talk to people who live there, and experience them a bit, your preferences change. You notice things you couldn’t have predicted.
            </p>
            <p>
                Again, more confusion first. Better clarity later.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve started to see confusion as a phase, not a problem.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s the phase where your brain is collecting raw material. Where it’s updating outdated assumptions. Where it’s learning what it actually cares about.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rushing to clarity too early feels good. But it often locks you into a decision shaped by incomplete data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Clarity that comes after exploration feels different. It’s quieter. Less anxious. You’re not trying to convince yourself as much.
            </p>
            <h3>So if you’re standing at a crossroads, my suggestion is simple:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Don’t rush to decide.</li>
                <li>Widen the search.</li>
                <li>Talk to people.</li>
                <li>Explore small possibilities.</li>
                <li>Let yourself feel confused for a while.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Then, once you’ve seen enough, let clarity emerge.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Confusion before clarity.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                That order matters.
            </p>
        </>
    );
