                Oliver Burkeman's <em>Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals</em> is a refreshing antidote to the toxic productivity culture. It starts with a startling fact: if you live to be 80, you have roughly 4,000 weeks on Earth. That's it.

            <h2>The Efficiency Trap</h2>
            <p>
                We often believe that if we just find the right system, get up earlier, or work harder, we can clear the decks and finally get on top of everything. Burkeman calls this the "efficiency trap." The more efficient you become, the more work you generate, and the busier you feel. You will never clear the decks.

            <h2>Embracing Finitude</h2>
            <p>
                The core message is to accept our limitations. We cannot do everything. We will inevitably miss out on almost everything. Once we accept this, we can stop agonizing over what we <em>might</em> do and focus on what we <em>can</em> do.

            <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pay Yourself First (Time-wise):</strong> If you wait until you have "spare time" to do what matters, it will never happen. Take the time off the top.</li>
                <li><strong>The Joy of Missing Out (JOMO):</strong> Missing out is inevitable. Choosing one path means rejecting infinite others. This selection gives our choices meaning.</li>
                <li><strong>Cosmic Insignificance Therapy:</strong> In the grand scheme of the universe, our anxieties and worries are tiny. This realization is liberating, not depressing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                This isn't a book about how to fit more in. It's a book about how to be okay with doing less, but doing what truly counts. It invites us to drop the struggle to master time and instead inhabit the time we actually have.
